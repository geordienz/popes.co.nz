Now that New Zealand is in 'Level 3 Lockdown', it is almost "business as usual" for us here at Popes, but not quite.
We are taking bookings for any of your electrical requirements but, due to the situation we now find ourselves in, it may take a little longer to get the job done.  With emergency situations we will still endeavour to call on you as quickly as possible. Please continue to call our main number -  07 542 3355.

Dear valued customers/suppliers,

We have all been hit by the effects in New Zealand of COVID-19 coronavirus.

Working in accordance with government guidelines, in tandem with our own health and safety policy, Pope Electrical have taken some measures to try and protect everyone from infection.

We would like our customers, potential customers, and suppliers to know that we value your health and wellbeing as much as we do our own employeesâ€™. 

Already, in our premises and in those sites where we are engaged, we have embarked upon a rigorous handwashing and germ-free environment policy (as far as is practical). We require that all visitors to our premises comply with this.

Our call-outs will still require "social distancing" and by working together we can continue to minimise the risk to one another.

Pope Electrical will be happy to continue to be of service to you during this difficult period and beyond.

Hoping we all remain healthy and safe,

The Team at Pope Electrical.
