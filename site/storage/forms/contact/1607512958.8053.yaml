  Hi,
  
  Do you accept a small job only? Do you provide free quote? Location Papamoa - residential.
  Scope of work will be:
  1) Install 1x LED light
  2) Currently my 2 switches are for the 2 wall lights to turn them on individually. I would like to make them both turned on by using one switch only then the other switch will be connected to the additional 1x LED light.
  3) Add LED strip lighting inside wardrobe
  Thank you,
  John
