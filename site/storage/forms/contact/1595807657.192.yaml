  Hi there,
  
  I hope to secure a quote for replacing a bathroom fan and delayed timer.
  
  We also have a cabin on the front lawn that needs power points, lights and porch lights.
  
  Quotes for both these jobs would be great.
  
  Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
  
  Cheers,
  
  Kelly
