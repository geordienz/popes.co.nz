  I am having trouble finding service providers who would help me resolve a problem with my inverter
  (I have a 2.5kW domestic system installed about 8 years ago but the Samil (or Solar River) inverter
  which has already been replaced some years ago under warranty) has a Relay Failure warning light up
  and no power is being received into my ac system. The original supplier has gone bust and teh 2
  contacts I had are not helping other than to say the unit needs to be replaced (which may well be
  true).
