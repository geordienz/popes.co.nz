  emergency light testing at 80 Parton road
  
  Hi
  
  I have rung twice and emailed and still haven't had a response.
  
  We have had reported emergency light fitting failure on the ground floor. Pope did the install for this building. Can you attend site run an emergency light test and replace any failed fittings that don't last the minimum required 30 minutes of full illumination.
  
  can someone please call and confirm this is booked in
