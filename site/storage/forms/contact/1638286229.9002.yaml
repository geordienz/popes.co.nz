  Good morning,
  
  My name is Kieran and being a copywriter/business development manager with over 12 years&rsquo; experience I&rsquo;ve gone through your website popes.co.nz and noticed the following key issues:
  
  1. Psychological Triggers are Lacking &ndash; that &lsquo;convert&rsquo; your website visitors into customers.
  
  2. Sameness Exists &ndash; meaning there is an absence of &lsquo;differentiation&rsquo; to form a competitive edge.
  
  3. Site Architecture/Design - doesn&rsquo;t meet modern industry &lsquo;standards.&rsquo;
  
  4. Content &ndash; Not &lsquo;SEO friendly&rsquo;/failing to add enough &lsquo;value&rsquo; to maximise your conversions.
  
  5. Website - Missing &lsquo;optimisation&rsquo; to be ranked on Google&rsquo;s first page.
  
  It&rsquo;s time to Take Action:
  If you&rsquo;re interested to WIN &amp; Stand Out from your Competitors, and get more leads/customers/ sales: then we have the solution.
