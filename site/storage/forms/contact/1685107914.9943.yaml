  Good evening
  
  I would like to get assistance to install a solar kit I have purchased from the grid free web store (attached is the installation guide)
  
  My address is&nbsp;307A Matapihi Road, Matapihi, Tauranga 3175, I'm currently off-grid utilising a generator for power. The site is flat, I have a garden shed (1.2m x 1.9m) ready to have the components installed.
  
  I'm only requiring the wiring up of the inverter, batteries and components for the meantime as I will be adding solar panels in the near future.
  
  
  These are the following items that need to be installed&nbsp;
  * 10mm x 3m Combiner cable &nbsp;&times; 1
  * 8-Way Enclosure with Combiner &times; 1
  * ZBeny 200A MCCB &amp; Enclosure &times; 1
  * PV Fuse and Fuse Holder &times; 4
  * DC Isolation Switch &times; 2
  * 6mm Cable Red&amp;Black - 10m with MC4 &times; 2
  * 35mm&sup2; Pre-Crimped Cable Red&amp;Black 1 meter - M8 + M6 &times; 1
  * Honda EU22i Generator&nbsp;
  
  What&nbsp;I don't have&nbsp;is&nbsp;
  * Generator receptacle to plug in the generator to charge the batteries
  * A sub panel that connects to the AC out of the inverter
  
  I&rsquo;ve also attached the Installation guide from GridFree.
  
  Any questions please let me know.
  
  Regards,
  Te Mana
