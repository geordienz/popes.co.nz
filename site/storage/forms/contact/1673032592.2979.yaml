  Hi there,
  
  I am completing a purchase for a BMW i3. Even though I just paid them a few days ago, I'm still a little bit worried about this.
  Through Live Help, I was able to get in touch with them, and they confirmed that the delivery of the car will take place in 2 days.
  Anyone anyone have experience working with this company?
  Since I am quite scared about this transaction, I would appreciate it if someone could please respond to me as soon as possible.
  I have read some reviews on [url=]https://ukbusiness-forums.co.uk[/url]
