  HI,
  I spoke to george the other day about having a price on a replacement heatpump, currently have a older Toshiba unit that has stopped working, SparkNZ was doing some work at home and looked at it and said PCB board was buggered and to contact you guys. The Toshiba unit is a MODEL RAS-16NKV-A - cool 4.62 / heat 5.9Kw - so assuming it was installed to correct room size extra, a Price on a model in the current spec /capacity ranger, body size is 770mm WIDE as to not leave a mark on the wall when removed, hope this helps with forming a price.
