  Dear Hiring Manager,
  
  
  I hope this letter finds you well.
  
  
  I would like to reach out to introduce our private agency that works in staffing and recruitment of highly skilled workers, either locally or overseas, The Lighthouse Recruitment.
  
  
  We provide primary consultancy to match employers (Accredited Employer Work Visa) and employees after carefully scrutinising and reviewing the nature of role, work demand and cost effectiveness. We also have a team of immigration lawyers to assist in visa processing smoothly. We have successfully assisted clients in bringing into New Zealand highly skilled workers from overseas. and mostly from the Philippines.
  
  
  Our clients act as our partners, we work together to solve the immediate and long-term goals, and with this in mind I am looking forward to achieving this with a healthy and long business relationship.
  
  
  If you are in need of highly skilled workers, we can definitely help! We offer packages depending upon your budget or we can simply have a custom made one as per company&rsquo;s need - we truly believe that a personalised service would always be the best, backed up by a reliable, driven and a passionate team!
  
  
  
  Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me if you want to discuss the services we can offer by replying to this e-mail.
  
  I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  âœ¨ Keep your LIGHT shining,
  Josephine Lucas-De Guzman
