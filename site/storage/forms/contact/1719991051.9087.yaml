  Elon Musk has been getting Trumpier. A direct line to Trump may be next
  [url=https://bsweb.org]bs2site.at[/url]
  
  Elon Musk has sought to accumulate political capital commensurate with his extravagant wealth. In the past year, Musk has publicly opined on global conflicts, met with numerous world leaders and US senators to discuss artificial intelligence and his space and satellite technologies. And he has courted senior Chinese officials on their home turf.
  
  Now he is reportedly exploring what could be his next political project: Becoming an adviser to Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

  Musk has discussed advising Trump should he win the 2024 election, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Musk called Trump directly via cellphone to explore a role that could potentially give Musk significant influence over US policies. It&rsquo;s not clear based on the Journal&rsquo;s reporting which party initiated conversations about the potential role.
  
  The Trump campaign did not respond to CNN&rsquo;s requests for comment; Musk also did not respond to the Wall Street Journal, but Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told the outlet: &ldquo;President Trump will be the only voice of what role an individual plays in his presidency.&rdquo;
  
  Musk pushed back on the Journal report in a post on X Thursday, saying: &ldquo;There have not been any discussions of a role for me in a potential Trump Presidency.&rdquo;
  
  However, a potential role in a future Trump administration could expand upon the role that Musk played in the previous Trump administration, when he served on two business advisory councils before quitting them over Trump&rsquo;s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.
  
  The privilege of whispering in Trump&rsquo;s ear, should he win reelection, could give the billionaire &ndash; who is increasingly steeped in the rhetoric and imagery of the conservative culture wars &ndash; even more power on the global stage. Reporting that Musk and Trump&rsquo;s relationship has improved comes after Musk&rsquo;s politics have become more aligned with Trump&rsquo;s.
  
  Musk has made supporting right-wing causes &mdash; and extremism, in some situations &mdash; increasingly central to his identity. He has vocally opposed Covid-19 lockdowns and embraced anti-vaccine ideology. He has elevated conservative speech on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that he purchased in 2022. And he has pushed racist conspiracy theories about immigration.
