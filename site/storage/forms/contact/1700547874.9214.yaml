message: 'Bad driving! I was a few cars behind a Pope Electrical van on SH36 towards Tauranga (from Rotorua?) today 21/11/2023 arriving Pyes Pa Memorial Park roundabout about 5:00pm. The Pope van driver was very aggressively tailgating the car in front of it - about one van length behind driving around 100kph. Aggressive and dangerous!!!!!!!!!!! Please do better!!!'
