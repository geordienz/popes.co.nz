  Remittance request:
  
  Can I please get a remittance for the payment of $1860 we received on 26/08? The reference used was 04057-F9D9, which seems to relate to invoice 65/104521, but as this invoice is already fully paid I am assuming that this payment of $1860 is meant for a different Harvey Norman store.
