  No matter how successful &ndash; or lately, unsuccessful &ndash; Manchester United has been on the pitch, the club has always prided itself on an uncanny ability to generate the game&rsquo;s brightest young stars. The latest breakthrough talent, it seems, is 18-year-old midfielder Kobbie Mainoo.
  
  The teenager&rsquo;s emergence from the youth academy has been one of the few bright sparks in an otherwise difficult season for the team, and the highlight of his fledgling career came during United&rsquo;s thrilling 4-3 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Thursday.\

  After the host had seemingly snatched a draw in the 95th minute of the match, Mainoo showed his considerable potential by scoring a winner in the dying moments.
  
  The English youngster received the ball under pressure outside of the opposition&rsquo;s box before slaloming his way towards the goal, nut-megging a Wolves defender on the way. Then, when other players might have panicked, Mainoo kept his composure and guided a perfect shot into the far corner of the net.
  
  While his teammates celebrated wildly, Mainoo seemed to take it all in his stride as he slid towards the crowd on his knees after scoring his first Premier League goal.
