  Defined Online Reputations
  Your online reputation in the digital world is determined by how you are portrayed and understood. Reputations online are defined as:
  
  &ldquo;The general opinion of the public about a person or organization based on their online presence.&rdquo;
  
  
  
  Said, your internet reputation contributes to defining who you are, what you stand for, and the values you bring to the table as a person or company owner. Your internet reputation is entirely arbitrary; people make views about you based on what they learn about you from online sources or search results.
  
  
  
  These perceptions can significantly impact how others behave; an excellent online reputation can open doors to new opportunities, while a bad online reputation may prevent you from reaching your personal and professional objectives.
