  Hi there
  Wanting to get a quote on minor electrical work please (ceilling light + two double power points + extending the already existing ethernet cable)  - we are building a temporary room on one half of our internal garage for one of my teenagers and need to understand all associated costs prior to confirming with builder to continue work.  Pope electrical did our fit out during our new build with venture so thought it would be good to loop back for same level of great service.
  Thanks
  Tash
