  Hi there
  
  I wanted to reach out and let you know about our new dog harness. It's really easy to put on and take off - in just 2 seconds - and it's personalized for each dog.
  Plus, we offer a lifetime warranty so you can be sure your pet is always safe and stylish.
  
  We've had a lot of success with it so far and I think your dog would love it.

  Thanks and Best Regards,
  
  Gavin
