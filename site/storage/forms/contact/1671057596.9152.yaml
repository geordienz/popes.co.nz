  Hi there
  
  We are renovating our house in Brookfield, Tauranga, and want to install a heat pump for our open plan/split-level kitchen, dining, and lounge area. We have calculated we require at minimum a 6.5-watt heat pump for the space.
  
  The walls are unlined (no GIB) and the heat pump will be installed on the second storey, and the external unit will be installed on the ground (easy access).
  
  Could you please provide quotes to supply and separate quotes to install (according to the EECA's good practice guide) a heat pump with a heating load of at least 6.5-watts in the following brands:
  1. Mitsubishi
  2. Daikin
  3. Panasonic
  
  Thank you
  Ella
