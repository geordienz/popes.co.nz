  Popes did the install for Venture at our house at 179 The Boulevard Papamoa. We need help with 2 issues:
  1) the internet connection from the lounge to the ONT box in garage is not working. We need to check we are connecting correct cables to phone socket in lounge.
  2) the power socket servicing the garage door on the garage ceiling has failed and needs checking/repair.
  I can forward a copy of the original Popes power plan if it helps.
  I am out of the country and my daughter Natalie Turner Wright is helping me who also lives in The Boulevard. Please contact her to arrange a convenient time to attend. Her mobile number is 0204 144 5656
  Thanks and regards
  Ian Piddock
