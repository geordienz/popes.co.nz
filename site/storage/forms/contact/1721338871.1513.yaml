  Isolated and inexperienced: A portrait of the judge overseeing Trump&rsquo;s documents case from veterans of her courtroom
  [url=https://blacksprutbs2site.net]сайт спрут[/url]
  Judge Aileen Cannon had been on the federal bench for little more than a year when a senior judge offered to preside over one of her first criminal trials in her isolated south Florida courthouse.
  
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very lonely,&rdquo; Senior Judge Paul C. Huck told CNN of Fort Pierce, a small fishing and citrus community on the edge of the Southern District of Florida where Cannon is the only federal judge. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty sleepy town with a pretty sleepy courtroom.&rdquo;

  Huck ultimately presided over the March 2022 criminal trial &ndash; not because Cannon needed help, he said, but because he enjoys volunteering for trials in courts across Florida.
  
  &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d go up there and just spend some time with her and get to know her better,&rdquo; Huck said of Cannon, whom he recalled as &ldquo;very smart&rdquo; and &ldquo;very personable.&rdquo;
  
  Two years later, Cannon is now presiding over one of the most consequential and complex cases in America: the criminal prosecution of former president Donald Trump over his handling of the nation&rsquo;s secrets. And she&rsquo;s attracting nationwide scrutiny for how she&rsquo;s approached the case.
  Since Trump was first indicted a year ago, Cannon has dragged out the proceedings in ways that have flummoxed legal scholars and put a trial initially scheduled to begin last month on hold indefinitely.
  
  Several attorneys who have practiced in front of Cannon &ndash; and who spoke to CNN for this story &ndash; pointed to her isolation as one explanation for her conduct. Cannon&rsquo;s solitary post in the Fort Pierce courthouse, one that rarely sees high-profile action, deprives her of the informal, day-to-day interactions with more seasoned judges who sit at the other courthouses and could offer her advice, the lawyers told CNN.

  They also said Cannon&rsquo;s lack of trial experience, both as a lawyer and a judge, is apparent. In her seven years as a Justice Department attorney, Cannon participated on the trial teams of just four criminal cases. &nbsp;And on the bench, she&rsquo;s only presided over a handful of criminal trials &ndash; and Huck took over one of them.
  
  For this account of Cannon&rsquo;s judicial demeanor, CNN spoke to ten attorneys who have had cases &ndash; both criminal and civil &ndash; before her. The lawyers spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because of the professional and ethical risks of speaking to press about a sitting federal judge in front of whom they practice.
