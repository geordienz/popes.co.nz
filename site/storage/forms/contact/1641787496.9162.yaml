  I&rsquo;m looking for an apprenticeship for early next year, I have my level 3 certificate in electrical engineering and I need an apprenticeship to carry on studying for my level 4 certificate. I will be doing night shift classes so will be available to work during the week and weekends if needed. If you&rsquo;d like to talk or meet to discuss further, my number is 0278913537. Looking forward to hearing from you.
  
  Jacob
