  Lebanon says efforts intensify to reach ceasefire in the country
  From CNN&rsquo;s Mostafa Salem  [url=https://kra17-at.cc]kra4.cc[/url]
  Efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Lebanon have intensified over the past few hours, according to Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati&rsquo;s office, adding that contact between the United States and France is ongoing to revive a ceasefire proposal between Hezbollah and Israel.
  
  US President Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron proposed a 21-day ceasefire during the UN General Assembly last month. Israel assassinated Hezbollah&rsquo;s leader Hassan Nasrallah three days after the proposal and launched intensive attacks on the group, derailing the talks.
  
  Netanyahu publicly rejected a ceasefire ahead of the assassination. Prospects for a truce diminished further after Iran, who backs Hezbollah, fired a barrage of missiles on Israel last week.

  &ldquo;There are contacts taking place between the United States and France&hellip;with the aim of reviving the declaration of a ceasefire for a specific period in order to resume the search for political solutions,&rdquo; Mikati&rsquo;s office said on X, citing the prime minister.
  
  Mikati said his government is ready to implement the 2006 Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a permanent ceasefire and end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The resolution also stipulates that Hezbollah forces must withdraw north of the Litani River in Lebanon, and that only the Lebanese military should hold positions in the border area.
  
  Hezbollah&rsquo;s top official Naim Qassem said Tuesday that his group backs ceasefire efforts spearheaded by Shia allies inside Lebanon. This was the first time the group publicly endorsed a truce and didn&rsquo;t condition it on stopping the war in Gaza.
