  Hello, Im requiring some drop down power cables installed in our Hardware department over the new Makita Stand (Ask for myself, Connor F or Craig), One in our Gift-ware and Gardens departments (ask for myself or Lyn Ollington)
  There is a light that needs replacing in the staff stairwell, and we also need power restored to the entrance barrier arm of our Trade yard.
  
  Please let me know if you need any other information.
  Regards,
  Amanda Stuart
