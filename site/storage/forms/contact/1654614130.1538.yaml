  I think you've intentionally infringed our rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could possibly be liable for statutory damages as high as $130,000 as set forth in Section 504 (c)(2) of the Digital millennium copyright act (&rdquo;DMCA&rdquo;) therein.
  
  This letter is official notification. I seek the removal of the infringing materials mentioned above. Please take note as a company, the DMCA requires you to remove and disable access to the copyrighted content upon receipt of this particular letter. In case you do not stop the use of the previously mentioned copyrighted materials a court action will likely be commenced against you.
  
  I do have a good self-belief that use of the copyrighted materials mentioned above as allegedly violating is not permitted by the legal copyright owner, its agent, as well as law.
  
  I declare, under consequence of perjury, that the information in this message is correct and hereby affirm that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive and legal right that is presumably violated.
  
  
  Very truly yours,
  Johnny Witt
