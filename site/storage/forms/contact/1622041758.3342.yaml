  Hi there!
  
  My name is Dustin.
  
  Your website or a website that your organization hosts is violating the copyrighted images owned by myself.
  
  Check out this official document with the links to my images you utilized at popes.co.nz and my previous publications to obtain the evidence of my copyrights.
  
  Download it right now and check this out for yourself:

  I believe that you deliberately infringed my legal rights under 17 USC Sec. 101 et seq. and could possibly be liable for statutory damage as high as $130,000 as set forth in Section 504 (c) (2) of the Digital millennium copyright act (DMCA) therein.
  
  This message is official notice. I seek the elimination of the infringing materials referenced above. Please take note as a service provider, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act demands you, to remove or terminate access to the infringing content upon receipt of this notice. In case you do not cease the utilization of the previously mentioned infringing materials a lawsuit can be started against you.
  
  I do have a good belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the legal copyright owner, its legal agent, or the law.
  
  I declare, under consequence of perjury, that the information in this message is correct and that I am currently the copyright proprietor or am certified to act on behalf of the proprietor of an exclusive and legal right that is allegedly infringed.
  
  
  Regards,
  Dustin Wilkins
