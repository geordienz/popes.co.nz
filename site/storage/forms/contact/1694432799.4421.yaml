  Hey there,
  
  Hope you and your business are doing well. We've all been through so much this year!
  
  I'm really sorry to bother you, and I know you are super busy, but I have been checking your website, and it seems that you are not ranking well for your ad words and key phrases. I actually help businesses like yours get a better ranking in google by using 10 proven techniques below.
  
  I would really love the opportunity to work with you and your business, and bring your website to the top of Google&rsquo;s list - the sweet spot where you get clicks and more business!
  
  Please let me tell you some of the techniques that I can use below to help you get a better ranking in google search:
  
  1. Title Tag Optimizations are missing, I can add these to your site.
  2. Meta Tag Optimization descriptions are absent, I can add them too.
  3. Heading Tags Optimization - No problem getting those put in there.
  4. Targeted keywords are not placed into tags correctly.
  5. Alt / Image tags Optimization is not present - it would take me seconds to write these.
  6. Google Publisher is missing; I can set this up for you
  7. Custom 404 Page is missing and I can create this for you.
  8. The Products are not following Structured mark-up data, let me edit that in google webmaster tools.
  9. Website Speed Development (Both Mobile and Desktop) I can make some tweaks and show you a speed performance using GTMetrics or Pingdom.
  10.Content Creation SEO work-As a native English speaker, I can create fantastic articles that people will want to read and share, these will bring business to you by word of mouth rather than expensive promotion via google paid search.
  
  I'm sorry if this sounds a little technical, but rest assured, these techniques will certainly improve you ranking in search.
