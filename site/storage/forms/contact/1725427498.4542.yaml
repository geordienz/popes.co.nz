  Hi there. I called you on 2 August and again this week about finding out the alarm code for 16 Manuka Street which we've just purchased and tenant has moved in today. Both times you were going to find out for me if you have the master code on file. I havent heard back from you and now that tenant has moved in, it's become rather urgent. Could you please call me with next steps asap.
  Many thanks
  Tracy
