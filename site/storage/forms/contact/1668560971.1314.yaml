  Hi, I believe my dad has been in touch (Ian Piddock) about his house - 179 the boulevard in papamoa. He is currently away so I am trying to help. We are having issues with the plug socket on the garage ceiling for the garage door. Also there seems to be an issue with the cabling from the ONS box to where the modem usually plugs in the lounge.
  
  I am aware you guys are probably very busy but if it's at all possible are we able to book in a time to get these looked at?
  
  Kind regards
  Natalie Turner-wright
