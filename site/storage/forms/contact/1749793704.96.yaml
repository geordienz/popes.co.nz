  &mdash;
  Opposite a bed in central London, light filters through a stained-glass window depicting, in fragments of copper and blue, Jesus Christ.

  Three people have lived in the deserted cathedral in the past two years, with each occupant &mdash; an electrician, a sound engineer and a journalist &mdash; paying a monthly fee to live in the priest&rsquo;s quarters.

  The cathedral is managed by Live-in Guardians, a company finding occupants for disused properties, including schools, libraries and pubs, across Britain. The residents &mdash; so-called property guardians &mdash; pay a fixed monthly &ldquo;license fee,&rdquo; which is usually much lower than the typical rent in the same area.

  Applications to become guardians are going &ldquo;through the roof,&rdquo; with more people in their late thirties and forties signing on than in the past, said Arthur Duke, the founder and managing director of Live-in Guardians.

  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s been brought about by the cost-of-living crisis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People are looking for cheaper ways to live.&rdquo;
