  Hi I just had a query, we got the smart vent install in November last year. We had to reset it twice
  for erroring out. On these cold mornings should we still be getting condensation were there whole
  window is dripping wet? Just wanted to confirm or if it may be faulty we only seem to get the
  condensation when it cold.
