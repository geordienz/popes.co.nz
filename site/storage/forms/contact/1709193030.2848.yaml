  How can I determine if my phone has been compromised by a spy app? I noticed a folder named aweme_monitor on my Samsung S10, which I did not create. I also suspect that my mom may have access to my text messages, based on some comments she made. Could this folder be related to a spy app, and what steps can I take to check for and remove any spyware on my phone?
