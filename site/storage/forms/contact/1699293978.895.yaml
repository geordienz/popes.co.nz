  Pope Electrical installed our new SolarZero panels last Thursday at 72 Shakespeare street, Cambridge, this morning half our electrical sockets do not work, some fuses popped but resetting them have not livened the power sockets. Issue is probably unrelated to install but thought might be best if Pope Electrical looked at it anyway just in case it is. Look forward to hearing from you.
  Thanks
  John
