  Hi,
  
  I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to let you know about our new BANGE backpacks and sling bags that just released.
  
  The bags are waterproof and anti-theft, and have a built-in USB cable that can recharge your phone while you're on the go.
  
  Both bags are made of durable and high-quality materials, and are perfect for everyday use or travel.
  
  Order yours now at 50% OFF with FREE Shipping: http://bangeshop.com
  
  All the best,
  
  Gabriele
