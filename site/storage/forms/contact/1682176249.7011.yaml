  [url=http://antidetect.website] A fundamentally new anti-detection browser with anti-detection methods[/url]
  
  Ximera's work is based on the principles of cryptography, which make it possible to confuse digital fingerprints and prevent
  websites from collecting and compiling information about the activity of their visitors.
  
  
  In addition to the obvious advantage of providing anonymous and secure online activities, Chimera has other advantages:
  
  - Profile data can be stored in a convenient way for you. The choice is a database or your own device.
  - Data on different devices are synchronized with each other.
  - The possibility of fairly accurate manual settings &ndash; you can change the proxy settings, time zone, browser identification string and others.
  - Access to create multiple work environments.
  - Protection of the system from hacking if the password is entered incorrectly.
  - Data encryption on a one-way key
  
  Anonymous browser is suitable for both private and corporate use with the distribution of roles between participants.
  Install and enjoy protected viewing with anti-detection options.
