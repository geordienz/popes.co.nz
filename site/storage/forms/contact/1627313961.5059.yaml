  Hello!
  
  My name is Jennifer.
  
  Your website or a website that your organization hosts is violating the copyright-protected images owned by myself.
  
  Take a look at this report with the hyperlinks to my images you used at popes.co.nz and my earlier publications to get the proof of my copyrights.

  I believe that you intentionally infringed my rights under 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101 et seq. and could possibly be liable for statutory damage as high as $140,000 as set-forth in Sec. 504 (c)(2) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&rdquo;DMCA&rdquo;) therein.
  
  This letter is official notice. I seek the removal of the infringing materials described above. Please take note as a company, the DMCA demands you, to remove and/or deactivate access to the copyrighted content upon receipt of this notification letter. If you do not stop the utilization of the previously mentioned copyrighted materials a court action will be commenced against you.
  
  I have a good self-belief that use of the copyrighted materials mentioned above as allegedly violating is not permitted by the copyright proprietor, its legal agent, as well as legislation.
  
  I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this message is accurate and that I am the copyright proprietor or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is presumably violated.
  
  
  Best regards,
  Jennifer Johnston
