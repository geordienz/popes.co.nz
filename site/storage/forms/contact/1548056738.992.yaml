  Hello I would appreciate if you could provide a quote to supply and install a Fujitsu Model ASTG-09KMCA at our new Unit 504/11 Kamahi Cres (Golden Sands Lifestyle Village). I understand that the main switchboard provides for a heat pump and outside power is in place on the back wall. We would like the unit to be installed above (or as near as) the window at the back of unit.
  Unfortunately we are in Auckland at the moment - you maybe able to visit the site - the agent is on site Tuesday - Thursday or someone may give you access.
  .Hopefully you can assistance - you were recommended to me by my son David Douglas - you installed a heat pump in his property on The Boulevard.
  Regards
  Leon Mackie
