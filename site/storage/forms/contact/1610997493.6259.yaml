  Hi, I am looking to get a heat pump installed in a 3.4x4m bedroom. The primary purpose is cooling in summer as I often work night shift and need to sleep in the day. The room has double glazing and is insulated so heating in winter is not so important.
  Please may you give me a quote on this?
  Thanks, Michael
