message: 'special events photography has indefinitely had a fulfilling facet in our hobbies. In elementary school &nbsp;you would find me carrying a thirty five mm professional camera in my hands taking photos of my best buddies and a few weddings, and the luscious locales around the smallish inlet town in the Maryland port where I were raised. This sport grew with time into a finite art form which I followed, studying article portraiture and natural photography in my teenage and young adult life. &nbsp;Not long after, I instigated forging a demanding wedding photography career plan in which beautiful notions and life enhancing vibes began to bloom and become visible inside my photography jobs. Now and forever I am a full-time in demand and award winning Seattle Washington Headshot top Photographer and cover all about United States as well as all of Washington. I am also a highly sought Seattle Washington business product Photographer.
