  Good Morning
  
  
  
  My name is Jack, I am 24 and I&rsquo;m keen to start a career as an electrician. I&rsquo;m getting in touch to see if you&rsquo;re currently offering any apprenticeships, or if you might be looking for an apprentice soon.
  
  
  
  I&rsquo;m hardworking, eager to learn, and keen to get hands-on experience in the trade. I&rsquo;d really appreciate the chance to be part of your team and to learn from experienced electricians.
  
  
  
  If there&rsquo;s anything available, Ive attached  my resume or if you want I can come in for a chat. Thanks for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
  
  
  
  Cheers,
  
  Jack Perham-Turner
