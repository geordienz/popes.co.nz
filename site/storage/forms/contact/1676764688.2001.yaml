  Hi There,
  We have had the Electrical Cable from the Power Pole to the House come down at 22 Lucknow Road, Havelock North. Unison have temrinated the cable off. We cannot get hold of Unison to reinstate a new cable - and understannd that Popes also do this work? We have a 16m siccor lift onsite from late Sunday 19th through Monday 20th - and there is an opportunity to reinstate cable, (with all buidling repairs being complete) if is anyone avaible (understanding the workloads)?
  Coudl you please make contact, may thanks.
  Regards,
  Michael
