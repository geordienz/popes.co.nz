  It is imperative to take action by expressing your concerns regarding the ongoing situation in Gaza. One way to do this is by publicly urging your government to cease hostilities and provide humanitarian aid to the affected population. If you find yourself unable to take direct action, consider sharing this message along with the relevant links with at least four acquaintances, encouraging them to do the same. This will help raise awareness about the current crisis. It is a tragic irony that those who suffered during the Holocaust are now perceived as contributing to a new tragedy against the Palestinian people in Gaza.
  
  if you do not do this also then you do not have a HART
