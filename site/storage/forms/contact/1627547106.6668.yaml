  Hello there!
  
  My name is Angela.
  
  Your website or a website that your organization hosts is infringing on a copyright protected images owned by myself.
  
  Check out this doc with the URLs to my images you utilized at popes.co.nz and my previous publication to obtain the evidence of my copyrights.

  I think you have willfully violated my rights under 17 USC Section 101 et seq. and can be liable for statutory damages as high as $140,000 as set-forth in Sec. 504 (c)(2) of the Digital millennium copyright act (DMCA) therein.
  
  This letter is official notice. I seek the removal of the infringing materials referenced above. Take note as a company, the Dmca requires you, to remove or deactivate access to the copyrighted materials upon receipt of this particular notification letter. If you do not cease the use of the above mentioned infringing content a legal action will likely be started against you.
  
  I have a good self-belief that utilization of the copyrighted materials mentioned above as allegedly violating is not permitted by the copyright owner, its agent, or the laws.
  
  I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this letter is correct and that I am currently the copyright proprietor or am permitted to act on behalf of the proprietor of an exclusive and legal right that is presumably violated.
  
  
  Best regards,
  Angela Martinez
