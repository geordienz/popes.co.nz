  Hi, We had a guy come through this morning at 505 Webb Drive (didn't catch his name unfortunatley!). He replaced some down lights under warrenty, he also looked at a bathroom extractor unit which wasn't performing well and found it was connected to another duct, he suggested a valve control coul dbe installed. I wasn't sure if he would pass this on to organise so I'm folowing up here just in case.
  
  A second query, my mother in-laws house needs a couple of range hood lights replaced, we think the drivers plus they are looking to install an extractor fan into a toilet. Are you able to offer a quote?
  
  Cheers,
  Yang
