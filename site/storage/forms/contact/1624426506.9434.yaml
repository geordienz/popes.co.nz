  Good day guys!
  My name is Bruno De Oliveira, I am 47 years old originally from Brazil but living in NZ since 2001 as a Mount Maunganui local. I would like to explain my situation to you guys and see if I could have some training/work opportunity with you. I am an electrician but unfortunately I don't have registration with EWRB. I have completed all the qualification required at school BOP Polytechnic (Electrical Engineering levels 2,3 and 4) on my own. I tried heaps but I never managed to get a sponsor so I decided to carry on and paid for everything myself. I have passed already both EWRB's exams (regs and theory). In 2013 I went back home(Brazil) and did an extensive 6 month electrical course and some cabling and fittings installation work. Back in NZ I worked at the Lighthouse for 3 years where I did heaps of light fittings (all sorts) assembling and installations and some table lamps repair. I have also worked at KCS Switchgear for nearly a year putting switchboards (all sizes) together. Sometimes I do freelance work for friends and family. My main goal is to become a registered electrician and progress. I know the industry is crying for professionals and, even though I have the skills and knowledge to do a lot of electrical work, it has been very difficult for me to get a job because I don't have the ticket or even an TLC. You surely had an application or a contact from me in the past, maybe more than once.
  
  Now I have decided to do a more close personal approach with the most reputable electricians in town like you guys to see if I can get someone to help me get my practice license and start work, learning the tricks of the trade and improving.&nbsp; At this stage I am not concerned about money at all, happy to work on the minimum wage, full-time, part time or even casual for big projects. I just need a few hours a week to get going and I will be installing heat pumps and doing electrical maintenance at no time. Happy to pay all costs with registration and apprenticeships. All I want is to obtain my licence and be registered so I can work with what I like and become better and better everyday. To achieve that I need to find employment in the industry. I know the industry is always busy and there are plenty of jobs being advertised all the time, but It seems that us apprentices are left behind as you guys only want to hire already qualified men. So can you help me? And even if you can&rsquo;t do it right now, I would appreciate if you could keep me in mind for the next opportunity. At the moment, I am keeping myself busy working on log ships bound for China as a in-transit technician (fumigation technician) but I would drop any work I am doing at the time to start with you. It would be equally appreciated if you could spread the word in the industry and refer me to someone that could help. I am a well educated young adult, smart, reliable and fast learner willing to go the extra mile at work to achieve my goal wich is to become a registered electrician. Just show me how to do a job properly and I will do it on my own very promptly. In return I will offer you my loyalty and my hard work to honor the business standards and values. If you feel you could give me a hand on this I would be eternally grateful. Let me know if I could catch up for a chat in the office. Looking forward to hear back from you. Thank you very much.
  Kind regards,
  Bruno De Oliveira - 0212134848.
