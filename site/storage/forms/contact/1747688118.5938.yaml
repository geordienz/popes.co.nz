  Hi there, I'm wanting to add a couple of power points (one internal and another one external) and also an additional network outlet (internal). None of the them require long runs since they're close to other plugs.
  
  I'm in Papamoa East.
  
  Could you please let me know a rough estimate for this work?
  
  Regards,
  Leandro
