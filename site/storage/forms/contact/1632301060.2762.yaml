  Hi there,
  
  We live in 47 Butterworth Cres, Papamoa. The house is about 6 years old and we have three LED lights out. We are wondering since Pope Electrical installed the main fuse box, if we could get the lights replaced under manufacturers warranty? We of course would pay for your labor to replace them.
  
  Please contact me to arrange a time to quote on site if needed.
  
  Thanks
