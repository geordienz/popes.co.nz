  Hi there,
  
  We have a Heatpump installed in 2018-2019 and the outdoor units cable/connection that enters the house from the exterior has what I'd call 'disintegrated' and you can nearly see all the wiring. I was wondering if this is something you'd be able to assist us with?
  
  We are local: 3 Kanapa Close, Papamoa, Tauranga, 3118.
  
  Look forward to hearing from you.
  
  Ridge Melville
