  Dear pope electrical
  
  I hope this email finds you well.  I was emailing in regards to my recent application to come on board as an apprentice at pope electrical. As my CV outlined I am a dedicated and hardworking Apprentice that has over 2 years of experience made up of both residential and industrial electrical work. However, due to the new apprentice unit standard unfortunately I haven't been able to carry over my experience/ credits that go towards my qualification. Therefore, I ask that you please consider my application as I am eager to bring my dedication and enthusiasm to Switched on Electrical. For any additional information please contact me on :
  0284012748
  
  Kind regards
  Jason Brar
