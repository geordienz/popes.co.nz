  Hi Popes team,
  I&rsquo;d like some advice on adding an extra power point(s) in our garage. We currently have a washing machine, dryer and fridge/freezer running off a double plug with the washing machine and dryer connected via a multi box. When both are running, it trips the cutoff on the multibox. We need a solution so that we can run the three appliances in one location.
  Secondly, our TV should run from the Lan cable that was installed when our house was built but the cable doesn&rsquo;t connect and we have to use wifi. Popes did the cabling when our house was built 5 years ago. We need advice on how to connect the TV via the installed LAN cable.
  
  We are available any day up to Jan 9th. Can you please advise if you can send someone in that timeframe? Thanks
