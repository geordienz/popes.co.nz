  Kate Winslet is sharing an anecdote about a &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; encounter she recently had with someone from her star-making blockbuster film &ldquo;Titanic.&rdquo;
  
  The Oscar winner was a guest on &ldquo;The Graham Norton Show&rdquo; this week, where she discussed her new film &ldquo;Lee,&rdquo; in which she plays the fashion model-turned-war photographer Lee Miller from the World War II era.

  Winslet recounted that while she had previously executive produced a number of her projects, &ldquo;Lee&rdquo; was the first movie where she served as a full-on producer. That required her involvement from &ldquo;beginning to end,&rdquo; including when the film was scored in post-production.
  
  She explained to Norton that when she attended the recording of the film&rsquo;s score in London, while looking at the 120-piece orchestra, she saw someone who looked mighty familiar to her.
  
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at this violinist and I thought, &lsquo;I know that face!&rsquo;&rdquo; she said.
  
  At one point, other musicians in the orchestra pointed to him while mouthing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; to her, and it continued to nag at Winslet, prompting her to wonder, &ldquo;Am I related to this person? Who is this person?&rdquo;
  
  Finally, at the end of the day, the &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; star went in to where the orchestra was to meet the mystery violinist, and she was delighted to realize he was one of the violinists who played on the ill-fated Titanic ocean liner as it sank in James Cameron&rsquo;s classic 1997 film.
  &ldquo;It was that guy!&rdquo; Winslet exclaimed this week, later adding, &ldquo;it was just wonderful&rdquo; to see him again.
  
  &ldquo;We had so many moments like that in the film, where people I&rsquo;ve either worked with before, or really known for a long time, kind of grown up in the industry with, they just showed up for me, and it was incredible.&rdquo;
  
  &ldquo;Lee&rdquo; released in theaters in late September, and is available to rent or buy on AppleTV+ or Amazon Prime.
