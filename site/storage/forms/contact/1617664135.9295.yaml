  Hi there
  I would like to book an appointment to have my new spa hooked up please.  The spa is from Alpine spas, the specfications say for power it needs to be 15 AMP, however the consultant mentioned that if we got 25 we could run both the heat and the jets at same time.  So curious about costs invovled in both options please.  You guys have done work in the past on my 3 year old home, and we have a outside power outlet installed already which might cater for this, but there is a bit of distance between as spa is in corner of deck - hoping you guys can help us get our spa up and running.  Thank you :)
