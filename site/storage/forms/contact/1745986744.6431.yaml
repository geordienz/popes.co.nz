  Hi, I think you originially wired our house in sanctuary point. We are looking at expanding our Heat pump system to have either a multi room system or a ducted in roof system.
  Currently we have a fujitsu heat pump in our living + outdoor unit and a smart vent positive 2 ducted aircon system so seeing which options for upgrading are the best.
