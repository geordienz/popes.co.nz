message: 'Hi there I&rsquo;m hoping to have an electrician come to our property in Papamoa east next week or the following ideally the Tuesday or Wednesday. Issue is we&rsquo;ve a light in the wardrobe that&rsquo;s not working correctly (it blew the bulb) and I&rsquo;m hoping to either have it fixed/assessed and or made to a batton holder light? It is currently a recessed light fitting.'
